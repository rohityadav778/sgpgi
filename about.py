<h1>ABOUT SGPGI</h1>
<p>SGPGIMS is an educational institute that imparts postgraduate medical training and a working hospital that provides inexpensive medical care. It is a tertiary care referral hospital that caters to patients referred from not only the whole of Uttar Pradesh, neighboring states such as Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Orissa, West Bengal, but almost whole of India and neighboring countries including Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, and middle Eastern countries. SGPGI is also emerging as a destination for medical tourism.</p>
<p>This autonomous institute is a University established under a constitutional act. Located on a sprawling 700 acres, the institute offers its own degrees, which are duly recognised by the Medical Council of India. The Institute offers DM, MCh, MD, PhD, Post Doctoral Fellowships (PDF) and Post Doctoral Certificate Courses (PDCC), and Senior Residency in various specialties.</p>
<p>The Institute has more than 190 faculty members in 29 academic departments. The academic departments are engaged in teaching, training, patient care and research. The Institute has a hospital-wide computer network with more than 500 computers spread all over the hospital and departments. Internet connections are available in all the departments. All faculty members, residents and students are provided with e-mail facilities. All the patient care activities are computerised, and the institute was the first amongst all government hospitals in India to implement the Oracle-based HIS system in 1997. The old HIS is now being replaced by a higher capacity internet based HIS- which will be fully integrated with the PAX and tele-medicine network, besides providing opportunity to patients to access their medical records and reports from their homes in a secure and convenient manner. Patients would also be able to more easily schedule consultations, tests and surgery from their home, and deposit money for those.</p>
